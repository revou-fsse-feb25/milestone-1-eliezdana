    <h2>Methodological Approach</h2>
    <p>
      My approach is underpinned by <strong>structure</strong>, 
      <strong>systematic planning</strong>, and <strong>quantitative analysis</strong>. 
      I integrate:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Input-Process-Output (IPO)</strong>: Capturing all relevant data inputs, 
        optimizing the audit process, and delivering measurable outcomes that 
        strengthen compliance.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>5Ms (Man, Machine, Method, Material, Measurement)</strong>:  
        Ensuring each dimension—people, technology, frameworks, data resources, 
        and metrics—are systematically reviewed and optimized.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>SMART Objectives &amp; OKRs</strong>: Setting Specific, Measurable, 
        Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound targets that map to organizational 
        <em>Objectives and Key Results</em>.
      </li>
