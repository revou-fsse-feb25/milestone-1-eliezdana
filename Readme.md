## Future Plans & Roadmap
This initial version lays a foundation but will **continuously evolve**. Inspired by modern developer portfolios like [Timmy O’Mahony’s](https://timmyomahony.com/) and [Olaolu’s portfolio](https://olaolu.dev/), here are some planned enhancements:

1. **Enhanced Responsiveness & Styling**

   - Add media queries for a more refined mobile experience  

2. **Project Showcases**  
   - Expand the **Projects** section with screenshots, demos, and case studies  
   - Integrate embedded videos or live app previews  

3. **Blog/Articles**  
   - Create a section for technical write-ups, tutorials, or personal reflections  
   - Offer insights into my learning journey and expertise  

4. **Accessibility Improvements**  
   - Ensure WCAG compliance by adding alt text for images, using ARIA labels, etc.  
   - Provide keyboard-friendly navigation  

5. **Contact Form Integration**  
   - Use a backend service or serverless function to handle form submissions  
   - Implement spam protection (e.g., reCAPTCHA)  

6. **Performance Optimization**  
   - Minify and optimize assets (images, CSS, JS)  
   - Use Lighthouse or similar tools to maintain high performance scores
